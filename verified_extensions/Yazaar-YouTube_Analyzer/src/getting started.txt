1. Install my very own chrome extension (found on chrome extension store!)
URL: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/html-agent/lbcelgpefmbllnhhlbgpkompbhmfblpi
2. Run "windows.exe" or "LocalStreamElements.py"
3. Find the line "starting website: http://localhost:PORT" on your console/cmd
4. Start chrome (they are giving you a popup each time that you launch chrome because of my "untrusted" extension)
5. Find the "HTML Agent" chrome extension icon top right in your browser (installed from step 1)
6. Find the text input "Import preset:" and paste the following (do not miss anything):
(comming soon... sorry...)
7. Remember to hit save on top after the import.
8: Insert "http://localhost:APP_PORT" but replace APP_PORT with the port of your LSE app
9. Hit "CONNECT"
"Connected" should be displayed shortly

"Host unreachable"? Check if the host and port is correct:
Find the console window for Local StreamElements and check what it says, should be
something like; "starting website: http://localhost:80" (insert http://localhost:80)

Open "index.html" inside of your OBS-client (or similar)
