1. Install the chrome extension (follow the video guide found in the same directory if you wish)
2. Run "LocalStreamElements.exe" or "LocalStreamElements.py"
3. Find the line "starting website: http://localhost:PORT" on your console/cmd
4. Start chrome (they are giving you a popup each time that you launch chrome because of my "untrusted" extension)
5. Find the "LSE YouTub-Analyzer" icon top right (should be a rocket)
6. Insert "localhost" inside of the "HOST" field (or your IPv4 in case of another machine)
7. Insert your PORT inside of the "PORT" field
8. Hit "CONNECT"
"Connected" should be displayed shortly

"Host unreachable"? Check if the host and port is correct:
"http://localhost:80"
host: localhost
port: 80

Open "index.html" inside of your OBS-client (or similar)
If the software is running on a secondary machine use this URL:
http://localhost/extensions/Yazaar-YouTube_Analyzer/index.html
