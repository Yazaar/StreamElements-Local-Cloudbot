1. Install my very own chrome extension (found on chrome extension store!)
URL: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/html-agent/lbcelgpefmbllnhhlbgpkompbhmfblpi
2. Run "windows.exe" or "LocalStreamElements.py"
3. Find the line "starting website: http://localhost:PORT" on your console/cmd
4. Start chrome (they are giving you a popup each time that you launch chrome because of my "untrusted" extension)
5. Find the "LSE YouTub-Analyzer" icon top right (should be a rocket)
6. Insert "localhost" inside of the "HOST" field (or your IPv4 in case of another machine)
7. Insert your PORT inside of the "PORT" field
8. Hit "CONNECT"
"Connected" should be displayed shortly

"Host unreachable"? Check if the host and port is correct:
Find the console window for Local StreamElements and check what it says, should be
something like; "starting website: http://localhost:80" (insert http://localhost:80)

Open "index.html" inside of your OBS-client (or similar)
If the software is running on a secondary machine use this URL:
http://localhost/extensions/Yazaar-YouTube_Analyzer/index.html
