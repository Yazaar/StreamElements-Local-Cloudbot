<h1>StreamElements<br>Local Cloudbot</h1>
<p>Use the best twitch chatbot, StreamElements</p>
<p>Use a modern version of Python (v3.7) and create custom chatbot commands with advanced functionality!</p>
<p>I strongly believe that this is the key to grow on a large platform such as twitch.</p>
<p>Which is why I built this software with full blown support of both Python 3.7 and JavaScript/CSS/HTML (browser)</p>
